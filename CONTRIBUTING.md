# Contributing

The general context of this repository is as a consumable store of sample configuration &amp; code for SAP Tech Bytes episodes and blog posts. If you find you do have something to contribute, for example to offer fixes or improvements, please send an appropriate pull request (PR). Due to legal reasons, contributors will be asked to accept a [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developer_Certificate_of_Origin) on submitting their first PR to this project. This DCO acceptance can be done in the PR itself - look out for the CLA assistant that will guide you through the simple process. SAP uses [the standard DCO text of the Linux Foundation](https://developercertificate.org/). Thank you!
