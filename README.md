# GitHub Organization Sampler

The content in this branch accompanies the post [Exploring SAP-samples with gh and fzf](https://blogs.sap.com/2021/04/05/sap-tech-bytes-exploring-sap-samples-with-gh-and-fzf).

Install `gh` by following the [installation instructions](https://cli.github.com/manual/installation), then [authenticate `gh` for use](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_auth) (you'll need to do this once only).

You'll need Bash too, but this is available on all platforms. If you're not sure, you could use a dev space from the SAP Business Application Studio, which gives you a Bash shell as part of the space. If you do this, just download the prebuilt binary for the latest release.

> It's the Linux AMD64 architecture binary that you need; for example, for release 1.8.1, the download file will be `gh_1.8.1_linux_amd64.tar.gz`.

Then you're ready to use the `org-sampler` script. Here's an example invocation:

```shell
$ org-sampler SAP-samples
```

Enjoy exploring the repositories in the [SAP-samples](https://github.com/SAP-samples) organization, there's plenty of content there for you.
