This repository provides small sets of configuration &amp; code relating to video episodes, blog posts and other content in the SAP Tech Bytes initiative, which it accompanies.

## Description

Where there&#x27;s sample code or configuration to share, specifically relating to an SAP Tech Bytes episode or post, you&#x27;ll most likely find it here. The structure of this repository is simple - there are individual **branches**, each one relating to a specific SAP Tech Bytes episode or blog post.

Perhaps most of the time you&#x27;ll be arriving at this repository, coming from such an episode or blog post, so you&#x27;ll be sent to the appropriate branch like that. But if you&#x27;re starting here and want to find out to which SAP Tech Bytes episode or blog post a given branch-based sample relates, you&#x27;ll find the back link in the README in that branch.
