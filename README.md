# SAP Tech Bytes

[![REUSE status](https://api.reuse.software/badge/github.com/SAP-samples/sap-tech-bytes)](https://api.reuse.software/info/github.com/SAP-samples/sap-tech-bytes)

This repository provides small sets of configuration & code relating to video episodes, blog posts and other content in the SAP Tech Bytes initiative, which it accompanies.

## Description

Where there's sample code or configuration to share, specifically relating to an SAP Tech Bytes episode or post, you'll most likely find it here. The structure of this repository is simple - there are individual directories within the [`samples/`](samples/) directory, each one relating to a specific SAP Tech Bytes episode or blog post.

Perhaps most of the time you'll be arriving at this repository, coming from such an episode or blog post, so you'll be sent to the appropriate directory like that. But if you're starting here and want to find out to which SAP Tech Bytes episode or blog post a given code sample relates, you'll find the back link in that code sample directory's main README.

## Requirements

Requirements may differ from sample to sample, so please see the README in the individual sample directory that you're interested in, for any requirements information.

## Download and installation

To enjoy this content, you don't have to download or install anything. But you can of course clone this repository to have the content available to you locally.

From there, in order to try out a sample, simply move into the appropriate sample directory, and follow the instructions in the README there.

## Support

For the most part, this content is provided "as-is" with no other support. But we will certainly also respond to well-formed and detailed issues raised against this repository.

## Contributing

The general context of this repository is as a consumable store of sample configuration & code for SAP Tech Bytes episodes and blog posts.
