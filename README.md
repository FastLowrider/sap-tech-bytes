This repository provides small sets of configuration & code relating to video episodes, blog posts and other content in the SAP Tech Bytes initiative, which it accompanies.

## Description

Where there's sample code or configuration to share, specifically relating to an SAP Tech Bytes episode or post, you'll most likely find it here. The structure of this repository is simple - there are individual **branches**, each one relating to a specific SAP Tech Bytes episode or blog post.

Perhaps most of the time you'll be arriving at this repository, coming from such an episode or blog post, so you'll be sent to the appropriate branch like that. But if you're starting here and want to find out to which SAP Tech Bytes episode or blog post a given branch-based sample relates, you'll find the back link in the README in that branch.

Here's what we have for you so far:

- [2021-02-17 Creating a Multi-module SAP Fiori Project](https://github.com/SAP-samples/sap-tech-bytes/tree/2021-02-17-multi-module-fiori-project)
- [2021-02-20 Approuter User API Service](https://github.com/SAP-samples/sap-tech-bytes/tree/2021-02-20-approuter-user-api-service)
